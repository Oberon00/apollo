Welcome to apollo's documentation!
==================================

apollo is a library that enables working with C++ classes and functions as if
they were builtin Lua types. It provides both relatively low-level APIs that you
can use to build your own abstractions and ready-to-use syntactic sugar for
table and class creation.

apollo was inspired by luabind but prioritizes flexibility, performance and
seamless integration with the Lua API. As a consequence, apollo offers (as of
yet) no complete class model (Lua doesn't have one) but instead provides you
with the means to easily build your own.
